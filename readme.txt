Game Rules:

--> The objective of the game is to win all of the cards.
--> The deck is divided evenly among the players, giving each a down stack. 
--> In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played 
    and moves them to their stack. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.
--> If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". 
--> Both players place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up. 
--> The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. 
--> If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. 
--> This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.


Program Design:
--> The application has been desingned using OOPS concepts
    The appkication is designed using Card class, Deck class, Person class.
--> Modules used: random: used for shuffling a newly generated deck of cards
                  pylint: To test if any compilation_errors wxist within the code
--> In case of war, both the players draw 5 cards. This has been implemented for simplyfying the number of rounds.
    Higher the number, lesser the number of rounds.
